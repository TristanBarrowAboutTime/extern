## Martin Fowler and CI

Who is Martin Fowler?

What does he say is CI?

[https://youtu.be/aoMfbgF2D_4?t=570](Who is doing Continuous Integration)

“Does everyone on your team commit to the main line trunk at least once a day?”

“Do you have a solid battery of tests so that you are confident you can find a
bug before it goes into production?”

“If you get a production failure and your pipeline breaks do you fix it within 10 - 20 min?”

“Those who have their hands up can say they are doing continuous integration.”

-- Martin Fowler

Also Martin Fowler "smaller changes == lower risk"

The whole situation is about lowering the risk that bugs will be introduced or that brakeages will happen. If the size of the change is some what proportional to the risk taken on then small changes are what will decrease risk.

## Robert C. Martin's Advice (April / May)

Tristan,

I just saw this in my inbox.  (My email is a challenge at best).  

I know this is a month late, and I imagine you have come to terms with the
situation and made the best decision you could make.  So my advice, at this
point, is probably out of date.

Nevertheless, here’s what I think.  You need a new job.  The value system you
are using is opposed to the value system of those you work with.  This is not
stable, and will cause you no end of stress and disappointment.

I would not do anything rash.  Simply look around for a new place of employment
that has a value system closer to your own.  Once you have found it, leave your
current employment on good terms.  Write a complimentary resignation letter
saying what a wonderful experience and great opportunity it was to work there. 

Robert C. Martin

## what about these "Conditions"?

Really I just want to be in an environment that follows the council of the current body of knowledge.
